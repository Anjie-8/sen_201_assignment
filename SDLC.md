SEN 201 ASSIGNMENT: SDLC FOR A SIMPLE CALCULATOR APPLICATION PROJECT  

1. Requirement Analysis:
Identified the main features: the calculator must perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Determined the input and output formats (user enters numbers and operations, program returns the result).
Considered edge cases, like division by zero.

2. Design
Planned the structure of the program:
A main function to handle the program flow.
Separate functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
Decided on how the user interface will work (console-based input/output).

3. Implementation
Wrote the Python code for the calculator.
Implemented the planned functions and connected them to the main program.
Ensured the code structure and naming conventions match the plan.

4. Testing
Tested each operation with different numbers.
Checked for errors like division by zero or invalid inputs.
Verified that the program outputs the correct result in all cases.
5. Deployment
Uploaded the Python file and README to GitHub.
Made sure the project is accessible for evaluation or use by others.

6. Maintenance
Can update the program if new features are needed (For example,  more operations or a graphical interface).
Bugs can be fixed easily because the code is organized into functions.
