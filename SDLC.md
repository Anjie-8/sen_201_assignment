SEN 201 ASSIGNMENT: SDLC FOR A SIMPLE CALCULATOR APPLICATION PROJECT  

1. Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis stage involved identifying the main features and expectations of the Simple Calculator Application. At this stage, it was determined that the calculator must be able to perform basic arithmetic operations, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The input and output formats of the system were also defined. The user is required to enter two numerical values and select an arithmetic operation, after which the program processes the input and returns the computed result as output.

Possible edge cases were considered during this phase, particularly division by zero. Identifying such cases at the requirement stage helps ensure that the system behaves correctly and does not produce errors or crash during execution.

2. System Design

In the design phase, the structure of the calculator application was planned based on the identified requirements. The program was designed to follow a modular structure in order to improve clarity and maintainability.

A main program flow was planned to control the overall execution of the system, including collecting user input and displaying results. Separate functions were designed for each arithmetic operation—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—to ensure that each operation performs a single, well-defined task.

The user interface was designed to be console-based, allowing users to interact with the program through text input and output. This design choice ensures simplicity and ease of use.

3. Implementation

The implementation stage involved writing the actual Python code based on the system design. The calculator was implemented using Python, with each arithmetic operation written as a separate function according to the planned design.

The main program was used to connect these functions and control the flow of execution. User inputs were collected, processed, and passed to the appropriate function based on the selected operation. Care was taken to ensure that the code structure and naming conventions used during implementation matched those defined in the design stage.

4. Testing

Testing was carried out to confirm that the Simple Calculator Application functions correctly. Each arithmetic operation was tested using different numerical values to ensure that the program produces accurate results.

Special attention was given to error conditions such as division by zero and invalid operator inputs. These tests helped verify that the system handles errors properly and displays appropriate messages instead of failing. Successful testing confirmed that the calculator works correctly under various conditions.

5. Deployment

After successful testing, the calculator application was deployed by uploading the Python source file and the README documentation to GitHub.

This deployment makes the project accessible for evaluation and allows others to view and run the application. Uploading the project to GitHub also provides a simple form of version control and ensures the project is properly documented.

6. Maintenance

The maintenance phase focuses on future improvements and updates to the calculator application. If new features are required, such as additional arithmetic operations or a graphical user interface, they can be added easily.

Any bugs discovered after deployment can be fixed efficiently because the program is organized into separate functions. This modular structure makes the system easier to maintain and extend over time.
